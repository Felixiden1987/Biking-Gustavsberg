## Testing 
- I have tested that the website works in different browsers: Chrome, Safari and Firefox.
- I can confirm that the site is responsive and looks good on different standard sized devices. 
  The functions are also working. I tested this with Chrome devtools device toolbar.
- I have confirmed that the form works. The input fields are required to be filled in correctly and it won't accept an
email-address without an @. The submit button also works. 
- I confirmed that the Header, About, Photos and Sign-up text are readable and easy to understand.  
## Bugs 
- I haven't had any bugs since i deployed the project. No broken links, just adjustments in css for the header.
